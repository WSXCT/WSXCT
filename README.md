Hello there!

I was an English in Shijiazhuang,Hebei. I have teached English for more than 17 years.<br>
Due to some reasons, I quitted teaching English, decided to sell jade instead, and returned to my hometown Tangshan,Hebei.<br>
During these years of teaching, I developed lots of unique opinions in English learning during the Senior High School period.<br>
My students (one of, in fact) wanted to save it from disappearing, by uploading all my works he can found to GitHub.<br>
Hope my works can help you.

薛老师是个很好的老师。他对英语学科有着自己独到的见解，并且有着丰富的教学经验，这使得他成为我们学校最好的老师，没有之一。<br>
但由于家庭变故和受到排挤等种种原因，薛老师已经退出了英语教学工作，并已经离开了石家庄。<br>
薛老师有着太多只属于他的知识点和方法，我~~们~~不想让这些知识埋没，就想出了这样一个不算方法的方法——征集薛老师的笔记，并将之存放到GitHub上。<br>
希望曾经是薛老师的学生，也就是我们的学长学姐们，能够帮助我们将薛老师的知识传承下去。<br>
谢谢。
